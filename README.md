To remove an employee from this list, simply swipe right or left, then the time will stop running for that employee.

The second screen will display the list of all the employees (either working or not). On this screen you can:
- Add a new employee
- Delete an employee
- Add an existing employee to the active list

To see the delete and adding to active list option, you need to perform a long tap on the list, then these two options will appear.
The bin icon on the toolbar is the delete option; the round button on the right-bottom corner of the screen is for adding the selected
employees to the active list.

The third screen displays the details of an employee. You can open it from first or second screen by taping on a particular employee.
The details of the employee is divided in two parts: unpaid and totals.
Unpaid, as the name implies, shows unpaid time and earnings. This is the amount the employer needs to pay. A pay option will appear
when the employee is not working.
Totals is just some numbers for reference to see the total of hours and earnings a particular employee made.
